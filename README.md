# Hitchens Ghost 
This is a silly (serious philosophy!) app for generating logically valid 
arguments in favour of atheism (or any worldview you fork it into). 

The objective being to mock how silly it is to simply provide
a large number of logically valid syllogisms from 
within a particular worldview without comparing theories.

Some humans have tried to do this in favour of their favourite 
worldview and I thought a computer (using a definition of computer 
which arbitrarily excludes those machines born of mothers as Turing would say!)
would be able to generate a larger N of valid arguments supporting a particular
conclusion... hence showing that whatever worldview the machine was 
employed toweard supporting was more true-er
